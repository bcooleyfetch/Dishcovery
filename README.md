_Take Home assessment for iOS Engineer Role_

### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

MVP: Started at 6:30 PM EST and finished first pass of UI and API logic at 7:34 PM EST. Using `AsyncImage` for my image caching, but when testing on device and throttling the network, it performs poorly with caching. Will probably build my own caching service or something in the next iteration. Also no unit tests are written. This is primarily because I want to add in error handling, and rework the UI, so I plan to write tests after that.
